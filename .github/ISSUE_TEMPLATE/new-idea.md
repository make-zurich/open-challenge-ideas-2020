<!--
1. Start by descripting in one sentence the problem you're trying to solve with your idea. Try to make the context of the problem clear and highlight why existing solutions are insufficient.

2. Then write down your idea to tackle the problem, in a good level of detail to get others hooked up! Include images and other graphic material if you think that will help getting your point across.

3. On October 23rd, during the kick-off, you will have 5 minutes on stage to pitch your idea to other participants and team up with those interested in it. No slides! This very same github issue will be on screen for you to present.
